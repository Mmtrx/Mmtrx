- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mmtrx
- 👀 I’m interested in script modding for Farming Simulator 19, 22. You can find the current singleplayer version of my [SeeBales](https://farming-simulator.com/mod.php?lang=en&country=us&mod_id=142151&title=fs2019) mod on Giants ModHub. And the beta multiplayer version [here](https://github.com/Mmtrx/FS19_SeeBales).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write / test mods for mutiplayer
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on future Farming Simulator mods
- 📫 You can reach me via comments / issues opened within my public repositories, and in the German [Farming Simulator Forum](https://forum.giants-software.com/index.php)
